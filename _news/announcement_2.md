New NSF project on Neural Joint-Source Channel Coding


---
Machine learning (ML) techniques are demonstrating record-breaking performances on many tasks such as speech recognition, image recognition, composing new documents, and even solving mathematics Olympiad problems. Encouraged by these remarkable results, machine learning-based techniques are now being researched to design better communication systems. An important communication problem is the transmission of sources such as speech, images, and video over noisy communication networks. To efficiently accomplish this task, the source must be compressed and encoded prior to transmission. This project considers the use of machine learning models for joint compression and encoding of sources, ie, joint source-channel coding (JSCC). One significant drawback of many existing designs of joint source-channel coding schemes based on machine learning techniques is that they use an end-to-end approach which obfuscates underlying mechanisms.
