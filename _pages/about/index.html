I currently serve as Co-Director of the <a href="https://connectedintelligence.github.io/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Connected Intelligence Initiative</a> and as the Associate Director for Educational Initiatives at the <a href="https://tamids.tamu.edu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Texas A&amp;M Institute of Data Science (TAMIDS)</a>. In addition to my academic roles, I am a co-founder and advisor of <a href="https://www.encando.ai" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Encando.ai</a>, an educational technology startup developing an AI-powered platform for teaching and learning.</p> <p>My current research interests lie broadly in AI-native wireless networks, AI-enabled compression and joint-source channel coding, coding theory, information theory, and machine learning, with applications in next-generation wireless communications (such as 5G/6G cellular systems and massive machine-type communications) and data storage. I have authored over a hundred peer-reviewed papers in these areas and have held visiting researcher positions at Qualcomm Research and at the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing at UC Berkeley.</p> <p>Throughout my career, I have been passionate about teaching and leveraging technology to enhance student learning. From 2012 to 2014, I served as the Director of Graduate Studies in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department, overseeing the graduate program and mentoring students. In my current role as TAMIDS Associate Director for Educational Initiatives, I lead the development of new data science education and training programs in collaboration with faculty across the university. I am particularly interested in using modern technology and AI to personalize the educational experience for students. This interest in innovative pedagogy is also reflected in my entrepreneurial efforts: I co-founded <strong>Encando.ai</strong> to build an AI-driven platform that supports teaching and learning, aiming to empower educators and improve student outcomes through intelligent tools.</p> <p>Link to your social media connections, too.
