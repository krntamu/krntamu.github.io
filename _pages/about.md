I am a Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Texas A&M University](https://engineering.tamu.edu/electrical/index.html), where I hold the Edgar & Yolanda Sanchez Endowed Chair. I currently serve as Co-Director of the [Connected Intelligence Initiative](https://connectedintelligence.github.io/) and as the Associate Director for Educational Initiatives at the [Texas A&M Institute of Data Science (TAMIDS)](https://tamids.tamu.edu/). In addition to my academic roles, I am a co-founder and advisor of [Encando.ai](https://www.encando.ai), an educational technology startup developing an AI-powered platform for teaching and learning. 

My current research interests lie broadly in AI-native wireless networks, AI-enabled compression and joint-source channel coding, coding theory, information theory, and machine learning, with applications in next-generation wireless communications (such as 5G/6G cellular systems and massive machine-type communications) and data storage. I have authored over a hundred peer-reviewed papers in these areas and have held visiting researcher positions at Qualcomm Research and at the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing at UC Berkeley.
